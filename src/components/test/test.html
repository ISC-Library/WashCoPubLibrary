<!-- This header is a two way data bound value -->
<!-- The "textToUse" value is a variable declared in the test.ts file... -->
  <!-- ^^^ Its value is set equal to the @input of the component -->
    <!-- ^^^ The value of the @input "myText" is set equal to a variable in the page that is calling this component-->
      <!-- ^^^ A two way data binding (seen below) is being used to bind that value to an element within the component view -->
